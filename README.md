> Attaching two GUI windows, enabling one to follow the other or move independently when detached.
#

This program demonstrates how to create two separate windows in a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library. The program consists of two windows: Window 1 and Window 2. Initially, Window 2 is attached to Window 1 and follows its movement, allowing users to see how windows can be linked and controlled together. The interface also includes buttons for attaching and detaching Window 2, allowing for greater flexibility in window management. When Window 2 is attached, it stays positioned to the right of Window 1 and moves with it. When Window 2 is detached, it becomes independent and can be freely moved without affecting the position of Window 1.

The program provides an interactive experience where users can experiment with the functionality of multiple windows in a desktop application. It includes a description of its purpose displayed in Window 2 and utilizes a dark theme for a modern look. The program also demonstrates how to dynamically update the position of one window based on the movements of another, as well as how to unbind events to allow independent movement of windows. This program highlights essential concepts such as window management, event handling, and GUI design using Tkinter, offering a simple yet effective way to explore these features.
